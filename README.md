### Small mathematical research to master programming

#### Activation functions

In artificial neural networks, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. A standard integrated circuit can be seen as a digital network of activation functions that can be "ON" (1) or "OFF" (0), depending on input. This is similar to the linear perceptron in neural networks. However, only nonlinear activation functions allow such networks to compute nontrivial problems using only a small number of nodes, and such activation functions are called nonlinearities. Activation function.ipynb script will plot the most known activation functions (ReLu, Sigmoid, Tangens, Step, Arctan, Gaussian) and show how they work in Python. For some activation function, two different inputs will be used. 

#### [Monte Carlo simulation of the number pi](https://github.com/Vitomir84/Mathematical_research/blob/master/Approximation_of_pi_number.ipynb)

The simulation works on the principle of generating random points in the square of the page r = 1.
Based on the distance of the point of the center of the coordinate system, it is possible to determine whether the point is inside or outside imaginary quarters of a circle. How is a quarter of the surface of a circle r^2\(π*4), and area of square r^2, number  can be approximated as k/m * 4  where k is the number of points within a quarter of a circle and m is the total number of simulated random points. As the number of randomly generated points increases, it is possible to calculate the number π with greater precision at the expense of time efficiency.

#### Area of intersected circles

This is a very hard task which aim is to calculate area under intersected circles. We will calculate the area of the connected circles based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The area of all non-integer circles will be calculated through the proportion of random points in relation to the area of a square (rectangle).

#### Bootstrapping function

When we want to calculate the reliability of some statistical estimation, when the standard error of some estimation is unknown, we can use the bootstrapping. We can calculate our parameter (e.g. mean or median) on our sample. Then we draw new samples from our sample with replacement and calculate our parameter again (e.g. median on every fake sample). Standard deviation of all our new parameters is estimation of the standard error. We than can calculate the reliability of our estimation.
